&lt;h1 id=&quot;build-a-responsive-mobile-friendly-website-from-scratch-design-a-mockup&quot;&gt;Build a Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Website From Scratch: Design a Mockup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;build-a-responsive-mobile-friendly-website-from-scratch1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/series/build-a-responsive-mobile-friendly-website-from-scratch/&quot; title=&quot;Build a Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Website From Scratch&quot;&gt;Build a Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Website From Scratch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/building-a-responsive-website-introduction/&quot; title=&quot;Build a Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Website From Scratch: Introduction&quot;&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; of this brand new series, I have introduced the main objectives of the series and given a short but complete introduction on the critical components of media queries and responsive breakpoints. Now, it’s time to begin doing some practical work. As I have mentioned before, I’ll start with the planning and creation of a mockup for each of the three main device types on which our responsive website will be designed, tested, and displayed: PC desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-start&quot;&gt;3…2…1… Let’s Start!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before continuing, I want to give you a little advice: remember that the more mockups you do, the more arduous and confusing your job will become. Responsive mockups are not the same as static mockups; you don’t really know where your content will be placed, because it depends on the screen size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, as we’ve seen in the previous series, designing mockups for every screen size is nearly impossible, because there are potentially hundreds of screens, layouts, and orientations that you have to accommodate. This is why I suggest that you select your target screens/layouts and build the project mockups only for your top three main devices’ categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, I won’t show you how to design and build the entire website, but I’ll focus on the homepage, although I’m sure that once you have understood the logic and basis of responsive web design, you’ll be able to proceed with building the entire portal and everything will fall into place. I should reiterate that creating mockups doesn’t usually require that you lay out every single view to perfection, and that they are effective as soon as they’re enough of an abstraction of the final product (website or app) that they give you sufficient information to begin building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to build my project mockup using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/build-a-project-mockup-using-balsamiq/&quot; title=&quot;Build a project mockup using Balsamiq&quot;&gt;Balsamiq Mockups&lt;/a&gt;. As I have explained in detail in the linked article, Balsamiq Mockups is a tool that helps developers to create wireframes and communicate with clients and coworkers with visual representations of their design plans. Balsamiq is offline desktop software, and you can work with it using the operating system of your choice, since it runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start planning the mockup of our website working on the PC desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, let me introduce the kind of website we’re going to desogm and all of the elements that we’ll find within it. In fact, when building a web app or website, it’s a good practice to identify your content ahead of time and designate respective content areas within the website template. For our purposes, we’ll build a website with main content topics like graphics, web design and mobile development, a place where the design-addicted can read articles about their favourite fields, discuss, learn new techniques, and stay informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how can we proceed using the elements of Balsamiq Mockups and focus on one target layout first. We have to work on the placement of blocks on the layouts, and as a first step, I place the browser window shape to represent the profile of any browser page and set its size using slight adjustments with the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the style of the main page, the first thing to determine is which elements we want to show on our brand new homepage. Generally, we might find a header, a newsletter bar, a menu-list, some sidebars (based on the extra-content you want to enter), a text box for the most important information, an image, or some links, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its simple, intuitive drag-and-drop system, we can easily add everything we want with a few clicks. For the first components of our page, we have to open the category called “Big.” Here, we’ll find the following elements elements: title/headline, the text area, and the image box. So, drag and drop each of these into your mockup.  Then, open the category “Common” to find rectangles, text areas, text input boxes, image and icons’ indicators, and link pointers. Let’s place the two sidebars to the left of the author information box (where it could be nice adding a photo) under the main content box, which occupies the full window width.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, our design concept should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pc-desktop-mockup1.png&quot; alt=&quot;pc-desktop-mockup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve dragged and dropped the elements, you’ll see that each element has extensive editing options. When you click on the title/headline or within the text box, you’ll see a typical text editor, where you’ll be able to specify the characteristics or content. You can modify texts selecting size, text alignment, format, and color. You can also set the background color, set the border color, add a scrollbar, and play with opacity and focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For images, we can show or hide a border, crop the image, and hyperlink the chosen image to lead to a new URL or screen. Since this is a mockup project intended mainly to keep in mind all the page elements and their arrangement, is not necessary in my opinion to make ultra-precise stylistic changes. What is important is to have a sort of “skeleton,” or a point of departure to fix attention on what is necessary to build into the structure with the help of the HTML code and the CSS3 styling rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we’re done with this first passage, let’s continue planning our tablet version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tablet-mockup.png&quot; alt=&quot;tablet-mockup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the image above, all the elements used in this second mockup are the same; the only thing that has changed is their arrangement. In the top part of the page, almost everything has the same style: the banner and the newsletter bar occupy all the window width on the PC desktop as well as the tablet version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; changed is the alignment of the menu-list items. In order to make the reading of menu items clear and easy even on a screen with a reduced size, I have planned to increase the space between all the present items. Additionally, the bottom part of the mockup introduces some slight changes: the sidebars that were placed on the left side of the author box have been moved under this and positioned next to each other in order to give them a larger width. Look below for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/smartphone-mockup-1024x521.png&quot; alt=&quot;smartphone-mockup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our last step in the mockup process, let’s tackle the smartphone version.  I have placed the iPhone shape (as said before, it’s the only one available to represent the profile of all modern smartphones) and duplicated it twice to allow you to view what the user would see by scrolling through the site from the top to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, for the top part of the portal, the arrangement of the newsletter elements has changed, andthe menu-item list is also different compared to the PC desktop and tablet mockups. The input box and the submit button are presented vertically in order to make the process of writing and sending data faster and simpler. As for the menu, the best solution to adopt in this case (since the menu is composed of only five items) is to create a drop-down menu that the user can easily touch to load the page he desires to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the other components of the page are set to their max width to make the content intuitive and accessible. Even if at this stage you cannot see it, for the text view, you can think about a simple trick to make your users satisfied. Remember that, if your content is too long, they would have to scroll down the page many times to reach the end, and this could easily cause disorientation and boredom. So you could solve this “too much content” problem by placing a “Read more” link that takes the user directly to the information he demands and makes the homepage more streamlined, easier to load, and pleasant to visit, even on a narrow smartphone screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ve seen how to build a project mockup thinking responsively and—consequently—how a responsive design can adapt to three target layouts: Default (PC desktop), Portrait Tablet, and Smartphone. We’ve seen how to arrange the elements of a typical website in the three main devices’ categories by creating a template that represents the common content elements. In the third part of this series, we’ll start to write the HTML code and work on the structure of the homepage and set the first CSS styling rules to build an initial design.&lt;/p&gt;

The Beirut Memorial was a gift from the citizens of Onslow County to honor the men that lived among us and gave so much. A solemn tribute to 273 Marines who gave their lives in Lebanon and Grenada on October 23, 1983. The names of each man are engraved in granite along with the words “They Came In Peace.” An annual Observance remembers those who lost theirs lives during the Beirut Peace Mission in 1983. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacksonvillenc.gov/index.aspx?NID=585&quot;&gt;visit web page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial
The Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial is dedicated to all men and women who served during the Vietnam War, and stands as recognition for the nearly ten million Veterans of the five branches of the Armed Forces who served on active duty during the Vietnam era, nearly three million of whom served in the Vietnam theater. The Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial is one of the largest Vietnam Veterans Memorials in the nation and one of only a few that lists all the names of the fallen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacksonvillenc.gov/index.aspx?NID=599&quot;&gt;visit web page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional Information please contact the City Manager’s Office at City Hall, 815 New Bridge Street, 910 938-5200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jacksonvillenc.gov/images/pages/N648/corpsmenmemorialmodel-shapeimage_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Corpsmen Memorial Model&quot; /&gt;Corpsmen Memorial&lt;/strong&gt; - In February 2008, the Corpsmen Memorial Foundation was established with the goal of creating a monument in honor of Navy corpsmen who fought alongside their Marine brethren. The Corpsmen Memorial will be a life-sized replica of the clay sculpture currently housed in Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, which portrays a Vietnam-era corpsman lying on top of a wounded Marine, whose right leg is in a makeshift splint, shielding him from impending danger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funds have been accumulated over the past two and a half years, totaling nearly $30,000. The memorial is scheduled to be completed and placed in the Lejeune Memorial Gardens near Camp Johnson within the next two years, if the necessary funds are met. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nccorpsmenmemorial.net/&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jacksonvillenc.gov/images/pages/N648/montfordpointmemorial02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Montford Point Marine Memorial&quot; /&gt;Montford Point Marine Memorial&lt;/strong&gt; - President Barack Obama once said, “Despite being denied many basic rights, the Montford Point Marines committed to serve our country with selfless patriotism… Embodying the Marine Corps motto of Semper Fidelis, Always Faithful, these heroes paved the way for future generations of warriors, regardless of background, to serve in the finest military the world has ever known.” Funding is underway and a memorial to honor the Montford Point Marines is planned for Lejeune Memorial Gardens. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mpmamemorial.com/&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jacksonvillenc.gov/images/pages/N648/rendering-museum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Museum of the Marine rendering&quot; /&gt;Museum of the Marine&lt;/strong&gt; - The Museum of the Marine is designed to pay tribute to the exceptional men and women, the Carolina Marines, whose training prepared them for service and leadership in the defense of our country and freedom worldwide. Within the walls of this 40,000-square-foot facility, we will tell the stories of the Carolina Marines, their units, bases and stations and epic battles, and of the Carolina communities that have supported them. Funding is underway for the museum that will be a wonderful addition to the Lejeune Memorial Gardens. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.museumofthemarine.org/&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lejeune Memorial Gardens Greenway &amp;amp; Trail&lt;/strong&gt; - Following the transition of former railroad tracks into trails to the base, in 2007 the City won funds to begin work on a missing connector from downtown Jacksonville to the current pathway into Camp Lejeune at the point of the iconic pedestrian bridge over Lejeune Boulevard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Jacksonville Greenway Trail is installed it will be with reverence to all of the memorials within Lejeune Memorial Gardens.  The path is connection. It will connect the Civilian community of Jacksonville with the Military community of Camp Lejeune. It will connect the revitalized Downtown area with pedestrians both on foot and on bikes.  Most importantly the Jacksonville Greenway Trail is a connection to our past.  It will connect visitors to Lejeune Memorial Gardens and to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Country.  It will connect future generations to the adversities overcome by the first black Marines at the Montford Point Marines Memorial and to the history of all who have served at the Museum of the Marine. The Jacksonville Greenway Trail will allow greater access for everyone to a site that preserves and honors the legacies of America’s finest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jacksonvillenc.gov/index.aspx?NID=644&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;were-looking-for-ideas-for-a-131-sticker-for-the-marine-corps-half-marathon-cant-use-the-usmc-eagle-globe--anchor&quot;&gt;We’re Looking for Ideas for a 13.1 Sticker for the Marine Corps Half Marathon… Can’t Use the USMC Eagle, Globe &amp;amp; Anchor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sticker needs to carry a tourism message consistent with our brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;message-considerations&quot;&gt;Message Considerations:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I Ran with the Heroes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I Finished with a Hero’s Welcome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I Received a Hero’s Welcome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-considerations&quot;&gt;Design Considerations:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Official shirts are pulling from the Marine Corps Blue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The red is considered “Blood” red. When it’s on the pants, it is considered the Blood Stripe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sword is used to separate the 1 and 2 for the Half Marathon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sword is a powerful symbol to the Marines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We can’t use the official font of the Marine Corps, but we can be close&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Christmas Cheer</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;onslow-christmas-cheer&quot;&gt;Onslow Christmas Cheer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###A Program of Onslow Community Outreach
&amp;gt; PO Box 4 – Jacksonville NC 28541-0004 • Permanent Number: 910 347-4646
Contact: Theo McClammy Executive Director Onslow Community Outreach 910 347-4646&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;christmas-cheer-applications-being-taken-now&quot;&gt;Christmas Cheer Applications Being Taken Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications for the Onslow Christmas Cheer Program will received Monday, November 17 until November 22, 2014. Onslow Christmas Cheer helps needy children and their families with offerings from the community. Toys will be offered to children up to age 12, and if resources are available, we will offer items for teenagers up to age 19.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications and donations may be taken on beginning at 10AM Monday, November 17 each day until Saturday November 22 at the 2014 Christmas Cheer Center. The 2014 Christmas Cheer Center is located at 2301 Lejeune Boulevard at East Street. This is the building formerly used by Stevenson Truck sales.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christmas Cheer applications will be taken 10AM-4PM, Monday through Friday, and from 5-7PM on Tuesday and Thursday. On Saturday, November 22, applications will be taken from 10AM-2PM.
Onslow Christmas Cheer processes the applications and provides references for groups and organizations wishing to sponsor families for Christmas. Other families or individuals are helped directly from the Christmas Cheer Center. Food and toys are offered based on the donations received.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donations of new unwrapped toys for children 12 and under are welcome at the Center. Donations of items for teenagers are our most scarce resource and we welcome donations.
Nonperishable food items are also welcome. Christmas Cheer attempts to assemble donations into a food package that provides about several days worth of groceries for a Christmas meal. The Salvation Army has provided a baking hen to help provide fresh meat for the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;groups-wishing-to-sponsor-a-family-or-individual-may-wish-to-let-shelly-bishop-know-as-soon-as-possible-sponsoring-does-not-open-until-thanksgiving-but-you-may-wish-to-talk-with-her-about-options-that-could-be-available&quot;&gt;Groups wishing to sponsor a family or individual may wish to let Shelly Bishop know as soon as possible. Sponsoring does not open until Thanksgiving, but you may wish to talk with her about options that could be available.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persons wishing to volunteer with Christmas Cheer should consult the Jacksonville-Onslow Volunteer Center at 938-HELP to learn when help is needed and how they may be able to help. Assistance is typically needed to pack boxes, arrange toys and escort families during the Christmas Cheer distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christmas Cheer was formed in the 60’s by ministers hoping to avoid duplication of their - churches’ benevolence during the holidays. Lists were to be kept of those who were being helped so that the resources could be spread to as many as possible. Today, Christmas Cheer expands that with direct service, sponsorship from churches and other groups and provides a ministry of caring during the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
